# Runtime core

This is the core runtime framework, defining concepts such as ItemTypes and Extensions, and providing the ability to validate and execute Items (and trees of Items). These concepts are very general, but they are used by Postman to represent Collections, and are central to Postman's ability to represent any type of request/protocol.
